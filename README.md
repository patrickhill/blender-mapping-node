# A Better Blender Mapping Node

This is an alternative mapping node for Blender that has all of the x,y, and z values for position, scale and rotation exposed for node inputs. This allows you to drive any of the mapping values with formulas, textures, or whatever you want. I escpecially find this useful for randomly changing position values inside of a procedural texture node group.

I put this together with help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAUmLcXhUj0&t=1236s">Bartek Skorupa's amazing video on manipulating texture coordinates</a> and this <a href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/58426/use-another-node-to-control-vector-mapping">helful StackExchange response by aliasguru</a>. I recommend going over both for a better understanding of how this works.
