# blender-mapping-node

This is an alternative mapping node for Blender that has all of the x,y, and z values for position, scale and rotation exposed for node inputs. This allows you to drive any of the mapping values with formulas, textures, or whatever you want. I escpecially find this useful for randomly changing position values inside of a node group.
